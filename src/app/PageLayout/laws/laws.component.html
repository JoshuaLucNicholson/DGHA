    <p>
      Most state-based legislation does list a number of areas where dog guides are not permitted and,
      in some cases, this is not consistent with the provisions stated under the Federal Disability
      Discrimination Act.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, under the Queensland Guide, Hearing and Assistance Animals Act, a dog guide
      is not permitted in an ambulance, while the Federal Disability Discrimination Act on the other
      hand
      would not prevent a dog guide from being permitted in the vehicle. The Australian Constitution
      states that
      in instances where a state law conflicts with a federal law, the federal law prevails.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dog Act 1976, gives police and local councils the jurisdiction to issue a penalty notice for
      failure
      to comply with the Act. This penalty amount may be a fixed amount, or may be determined by a
      number of "penalty units". The value of a penalty unit varies between states and may change on
      an annual basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although dog guides are permitted in most public areas under law, it is important to understand
      that there are a number of responsibilities that come along with this. Under both federal and
      state legislation, it is not unlawful for you to be asked to produce evidence to verify that
      your dog is a
      registered assistance animal. It is also not unlawful for you to be refused access to public
      premises if
      your dog does not meet an appropriate standard of hygiene or is not under your direct control,
      or the control of
      another person.
