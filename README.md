# DGHAApp Description

For our final Diploma of software development project we made an Angular site for Dog Guide Handlers Australia, an independent non profit association of dog guide handlers.

The aim was the create a mobile friend website that the vision impaired could use. The site would contain information regarding laws with guide dogs, a membership form as well as a review system so users could read and create reviews relating to guide dogs (if the dog was allowed into a cafe for example)
This app was made with a team of 5 over 2 months

Some things it uses;
Typescript,
firebase realtime database,
google places API,
firebase authentication
